# Pomodoro

Create an app to manage _Pomodoro_ sessions.

Features:

* Decide on the task at hand;
* Start the timer (25 minutes);
* Work on the task until the timer rings and the note as done;
* Take a short break (5 minutes);
* Every four _Pomodori_ take a break a little longer (15-20 minutes).

You have a basic skeleton containing HTML, CSS code and integrates Bootstrap and jQuery.
